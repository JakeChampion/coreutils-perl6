Perlutils - Implementing coreutils in perl6

## Using perlutils
1. Get perl6 - download an implementation of perl6 like Rakudo-Star
2. Clone the repo
3. Let shell find the commands in the repo by adding to bash_profile: `export PATH="[*path to perlutils bin directory*]:$PATH"`

##Â Making new perlutils
1. Use perl6 to code the perlutil version of the coreutil. Give the file the coreutil's name as its filename and save in the `bin` directory of the repo.
2. Make sure the file is an executable by running `chmod +x [*path to file*]` 
3. PR to repo

## Commands with conflicting names
The shell will use other commands with the same name as the perl6 ones, unless you give the perl6 ones precedence like this: 

### Disable built-in bash commands such as `pwd`. E.g. in bash_profile:
`enable -n pwd`

### Give precedence to perl6 commands over os commands with the same name, by placing perl6 at the front of the PATH. E.g. in bash_profile: 
`export PATH="[*path to perl6 directory*]/bin:$PATH"`
